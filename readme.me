important points for me to remember

important small tools devops engineers daily use.
1 . jq --> used to read the json format files used by devops engineers
2 . net-tools --> nslook, ifconfig for this to work we need net-tools tools
3 . unzip --> to unzip the file 

most important tools:

1. tmux --> to get multiple terminals in single screen. mostly used while checking something..
   1. (tmux) + (control+B) + (shift+")  -> to get a horizontal terminals
   2. (tmux) + (control+B) + (shift+5)  -> to get a vertical terminals
