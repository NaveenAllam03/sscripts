important info

when writing a script to install some software into a machine:
Follow these steps

steps:

1. check the user is root or not.                           # by default most of software install with root access
2. write conditions, only with conditions we achive this    # if, ifelse, elif 
   -> sample algoritham
      if [ conditon 1]
      then
          echo "statement"
      else 
          echo "statement2"
      fi

3. write exit codes to validate conditions                  # assurance for system to know it should go forward or exit
4. command to install <your-application>                    # write based of linux flavour
5. again command to check weather installed or not          # one more validation.
6. wite conditions to display sucess or fail                # if, ifelse, elif.
7. write functions for repetitive tasks.
   -> generally funtions are kept under variables.
